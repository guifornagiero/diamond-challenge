# DiamondChallenge

This project was created to track progress of a Bronze III friend in League of Legends.
He has until the end of season 13.2 (9th Jan 2024) to get Diamond IV.

I'll send requests to Riot API (https://developer.riotgames.com) to track the infos.

The project will be created using Angular 16.2.3, and it's only a front-end application to study.
